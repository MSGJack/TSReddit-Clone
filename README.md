# MiniReddit Project

This is a project that was part of the Codecademy Full Stack path. The original project was asked to be completed in javascript but I thought doing it in typescript would be more helpful. I wasn't happy with the reddit clone that I previously done since I felt that it was poorly done and didn't quite understand how everything worled properly. Was made with just typescript and css.

## Features

Clone allows users to view posts, read comments and their replies, toggle light and dark theme(orange for light and purple for dark) and save any post to favorite list and remove them if desired.
